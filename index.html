            <p>Hay there,This is Jamil and I'm a fullstack web developer. I'm feeling proud to say something about me,
                When I think about myself, the first quality that come's to my mind and I feel proud that I'm a quick
                learner and self motivated person. I've learn the basic coding by myself without anyone's help and now
                I'm a junior web developer.</p>

            <h1 class="margine">Dream big</h1>
            <p>It’s not enough to tell people, “I have a dream”; taking action is an important step to turning that
                dream into reality. Oprah Winfrey tells us to do our part and then trust that the <br> universe or God
                will
                allow them to happen for us. Don't ever let someone tell<br> you that you can't do something. Not even
                me.
                You got a dream, you gotta <br>protect it. ...</p>

                <p>A Front-End Developer is someone who creates websites and web applications. The Front-End Developer
                    creates things that the user sees. It is a popular job, and everyone can become a Front-End

                <h3>From June-2022-present</h3>
                <p>SEO stands for “search engine optimization.” In simple terms, it means the process of improving your
                    site to increase its visibility when people search for products or services related to your business
                    in Google, Bing, and other search engines. The better visibility your pages have in search results,
                    the more likely you are to garner attention and attract prospective and existing customers to your
                    business.</p>
